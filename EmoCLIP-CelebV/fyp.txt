Let me continue with the incremental training implementation:

I've completed the implementation of incremental training for your emotion recognition model. This code allows you to train your model in phases, using different subsets of your dataset for each phase and carrying over the weights from previous phases.

## Key features of the implementation:

1. **Phased Training** - The code now supports training in phases where each phase processes a subset of videos:
   - Phase 0: Train on all videos at once
   - Phase 1: Train on first batch of videos (e.g., first 10,000)
   - Phase 2: Train on second batch (next 10,000)
   - Phase 3: Train on third batch (next 10,000)

2. **Command Line Arguments** - Added command line parameters to control the training:
   ```
   python train.py --phase 1 --videos-per-phase 10000 --model-path /path/to/previous/model.pth
   ```

3. **Dataset Enhancements** - Modified the `CustomCelebVDataset` class to support:
   - `offset` parameter to skip videos
   - Sorting videos for consistent ordering
   - Detailed logging of which videos are being used

4. **Model Continuity** - Each phase saves models with phase-specific names and provides instructions for continuing to the next phase.

## How to use:

1. **Initial Training (Phase 1):**
   ```
   python train.py --phase 1 --videos-per-phase 10000
   ```

2. **Continue with Phase 2:**
   ```
   python train.py --phase 2 --videos-per-phase 10000 --model-path ./saved_models/final_model_phase1.pth
   ```

3. **Continue with Phase 3:**
   ```
   python train.py --phase 3 --videos-per-phase 10000 --model-path ./saved_models/final_model_phase2.pth
   ```

4. **Train on All Data:**
   ```
   python train.py --phase 0
   ```

The code also displays helpful messages at the end of each phase with the exact command to run for the next phase. This incremental approach will help you manage your large dataset without overwhelming your system memory.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?
